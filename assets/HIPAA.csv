Device & Media Control,Physical Safeguards,"Ensure portable devices and removable media containing ePHI are encrypted, tracked, and securely wiped when retired.","Inspect device inventory and try to access a recovered device image to confirm data is unreadable without keys, and verify disposal records."
Mobile Device Management,Physical & Device Security,"Enforce MDM controls: device encryption, remote wipe, policy compliance for devices accessing ePHI.","Check MDM console for compliance status and attempt to access ePHI from a non-compliant device in a test environment to confirm denial."
Workforce Training,Administrative Safeguards,"Ensure workforce receives training on PHI handling, phishing, and security policies with records of completion.","Review training logs for sampled users and run a benign phishing simulation to measure click/report rates and confirm remedial training assignments."
User Termination Procedures,Access Control,"Ensure user offboarding revokes access to ePHI promptly including accounts, tokens, and physical keys.","Verify a recent terminated user cannot authenticate and that their credentials are disabled across IAM, VPN, and application layers."
Least-privileged Service Accounts,Access Control,"Use minimal privileges for service accounts processing ePHI and rotate service credentials regularly.","List service accounts and permissions, and attempt to perform elevated actions to confirm the account cannot access non-required ePHI systems."
