Scope Confirmation,Planning,"Verify in-scope assets, boundaries, exclusions, and authorized test methods are documented and signed off.","Compare the target list against the engagement scope file and confirm access by pinging/connecting to each listed IP/hostname in Kali."
Rules of Engagement,Planning,"Confirm allowed test hours, throttling limits, no-go systems, and escalation contacts are explicitly defined.","Validate ROE by attempting a low-impact discovery scan on a non-production test host and confirming escalation workflow contact details."
Risk Acceptance,Planning,"Ensure residual risk and acceptable impact levels for test activities (e.g., DoS risk) are documented by stakeholders.","Log stakeholder sign-off and run a safe, limited nmap -sS scan with rate limiting to demonstrate adherence to acceptable impact."
Reconnaissance,Information Gathering,"Collect passive and active information about targets including DNS, WHOIS, IP ranges, and public web footprint.","Use `whois`, `dig`, `theHarvester`, and passive sources, then run `nmap -sL` and `whatweb` to enumerate hosts and services from Kali."
Network Discovery,Information Gathering,"Map live hosts, open ports, and basic service banners for internal and external network ranges.","Run `nmap -sV -p- --open` and `masscan` to identify reachable hosts and services and save results for correlation."
Service & Banner Fingerprinting,Information Gathering,"Identify service versions and protocols to enable vulnerability correlation and exploit identification.","Use `nmap -sV --script=banner` and `whatweb` to capture service banners and record versions for CVE lookups."
Vulnerability Scanning,Vulnerability Analysis,"Perform authenticated and unauthenticated scans to find known vulnerabilities, false positives to be verified manually.","Run `nessus`/`openvas`/`nmap --script vuln` scans from Kali, then manually verify high/critical findings with targeted checks."
Manual Verification,Vulnerability Analysis,"Manually verify automated scan findings to confirm exploitability and reduce false positives.","Use Burp, curl, and custom PoC payloads to reproduce scanner findings and document reproducible steps and evidence."
Password Attacks,Vulnerability Analysis,"Test password strength, reuse, and brute-force resilience for in-scope accounts within agreed constraints.","Perform controlled credential stuffing / password spraying with `hydra` or `smbclient` against allowed services, respecting lockout rules."
Authentication Testing,Vulnerability Analysis,"Check authentication mechanisms for bypass, multi-factor bypass, and insecure reset/recovery flows.","Use Burp to intercept auth flows, test token reuse/session fixation, and attempt password reset abuse with crafted requests."
Client-Side Testing,Client Testing,"Assess desktop/browser clients for insecure storage, protocol downgrade, injection, or weak update mechanisms.","Use `Burp` with a configured browser, test local config files for secrets, and attempt to manipulate update URLs to validate integrity checks."
Web Application Testing,Application Testing,"Perform application tests per NIST guidance: input validation, auth, session management, business logic, and error handling.","Use Burp Suite, ffuf, and sqlmap from Kali to test OWASP-related vectors and manual logic edge cases, capturing PoC for each exploitable issue."
API & Mobile Testing,Application Testing,"Test REST/GraphQL endpoints and mobile-backend interactions for auth, excessive data exposure, and parameter abuse.","Use `postman`/Burp and `objection`/`frida` on mobile builds to fuzz API params and validate authorization checks and sensitive data leaks."
Wireless Assessment,Wireless Testing,"Identify wireless networks, encryption weaknesses, rogue APs, and authentication hijacking in-scope for wireless testing.","Use `airmon-ng`, `airodump-ng`, and `aircrack-ng` to enumerate SSIDs, capture handshakes, and test WPA2/WPA3 config in an authorized lab environment."
Wireless Misconfigurations,Wireless Testing,"Check for open or weakly configured access points, WPS enabled, or default management credentials.","Run `wash` to identify WPS, attempt association to open SSIDs, and test known default creds on AP management interfaces where permitted."
Social Engineering,Social Engineering Testing,"Validate user susceptibility to phishing, vishing, or physical access under the agreed rules and with explicit authorization.","Execute pre-approved phishing simulations or role-play vishing calls and record click/credential capture rates as permitted by the engagement."
Physical Security,Physical Testing,"Assess physical access points, removable media policies, and workstation protections according to the test scope.","Attempt authorized badge cloning / door-access tests or leave a benign USB drop in-scope areas and document discovery/handling behavior."
Privilege Escalation,Exploitation,"Attempt lateral movement and privilege escalation from compromised hosts while preserving evidence and system integrity.","Use `mimikatz` (Windows lab) or `uname -a` and `sudo -l` checks, then test local privilege escalation exploits in a controlled, non-production environment."
Post-Exploitation Recon,Exploitation,"Enumerate credentials, services, and network connectivity from a compromised host to evaluate potential impact and pivot paths.","Gather `/etc/passwd`, SSH keys, scheduled tasks, and active connections with Kali tools and document sensitive artifacts for scope-limited pivot testing."
Data Exfiltration,Exploitation,"Test the ability to extract sensitive data from in-scope systems using allowed channels while avoiding real data leakage.","Simulate exfiltration by exporting synthetic/test data to an authorized collaborator endpoint via HTTPS or DNS-tunneling tools and log transfer attempts."
Persistence & Cleanup,Exploitation,"Assess persistence mechanisms an attacker could use and ensure all test artifacts can be removed post-engagement.","Demonstrate ephemeral persistence techniques in-lab and then remove created users, files, and cron jobs, verifying cleanup with integrity checks."
Evidence Collection,Reporting,"Collect tamper-evident logs, packet captures, and PoC artifacts necessary for reproducible findings and auditor review.","Capture tcpdump/pcap, Burp logs, and screenshots in Kali, timestamp files, and store them in the agreed evidence repository."
Risk & Impact Analysis,Reporting,"Provide a description of potential business impact for each finding, mapping to affected assets and likelihood.","For each verified finding, produce an impact statement and correlate it to asset criticality and CVSS or organizational risk matrix."
Remediation Verification,Retesting,"After fixes, re-test high/critical findings to confirm remediation and document residual risk reduction.","Rerun targeted verification scans and manual PoCs from Kali against patched endpoints and compare results to original evidence."
Reporting Deliverables,Reporting,"Deliver an executive summary, technical findings with PoC, remediation steps, and an evidence bundle per NIST guidance.","Assemble PDF/markdown report with prioritized findings, include PoC commands and pcap files collected from Kali, and hand over to stakeholders."
Toolchain Validation,Quality Assurance,"Ensure scanning and exploitation tools are current, configured for low-impact scanning, and produce reproducible output.","Validate tool versions (`nmap --version`, `sqlmap --version`) and run sample scans in a test lab to confirm expected output formatting and reproducibility."
Coordination & Notifications,Planning,"Confirm communication channels and notification procedures for critical findings or systems impacted during testing.","Trigger the agreed critical-finding notification flow during a safe test (e.g., accidental service interruption simulation) and log confirmation receipt."
Chain of Custody,Reporting,"Maintain a documented chain of custody for digital evidence and ensure secure storage and transfer of artifacts.","Hash collected artifacts (sha256sum), record who accessed them, and store in encrypted evidence storage accessible only to authorized staff."
Legal & Compliance Checks,Planning,"Verify tests comply with contracts, laws, export controls, and data privacy requirements before execution.","Review legal checklist and run a small compliance-only probe to confirm nothing in-scope contains regulated data that cannot be processed during tests."
