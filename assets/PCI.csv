Encrypt PAN Transit,Encryption & Key Mgmt,"Ensure PAN and other sensitive data are encrypted during transmission over open, public networks using strong TLS configurations (TLS1.2+).","Run testssl.sh/sslyze against endpoints handling PAN and verify TLS version, cipher strength, and that insecure protocols are disabled."
Encrypt PAN Storage,Encryption & Key Mgmt,"Verify PAN at rest is rendered unreadable via strong cryptography, tokenization, or truncation and keys are properly managed.","Inspect storage systems/DBs for plaintext PAN, use database queries and file searches to locate PAN and confirm encryption/tokenization is in place."
Key Management,Encryption & Key Mgmt,"Confirm cryptographic keys are rotated, stored securely, access-controlled, and that split knowledge or dual control is used where required.","Review key management procedures, inspect key storage locations, and attempt (authorized) access to key files to ensure protections are enforced."
Disable Weak Crypto,Encryption & Key Mgmt,"Ensure SSL/early TLS and weak ciphers are disabled across all services that handle card data.","Use testssl.sh and openssl s_client to confirm no SSLv3/old TLS or RC4/weak ciphers are accepted on card-processing services."
Vulnerability Scanning,Vulnerability Management,"Perform regular internal and external vulnerability scans and confirm identified critical/ high issues are remediated in required windows.","Run authenticated and unauthenticated scans (nmap, Nessus/OpenVAS) and manually verify remediation of critical findings."
Patch Management,Vulnerability Management,"Ensure security patches for OS and applications are applied within approved timeframes and documented for CDE systems.","Query system package versions and apply CVE lookups; verify patch level via `uname -a` and package managers and confirm dates against the patch schedule."
Anti-Malware,Malware Protection,"Verify anti-malware is deployed, up-to-date, and configured to alert on suspicious activity on systems within the CDE.","Check AV/EDR agent presence, scan logs, and attempt to place benign test artifacts (EICAR in lab) to verify detection and logging."
Change Control,Change Management,"Confirm a formal change control process exists for changes to CDE systems with approvals and rollback procedures.","Review change tickets for recent CDE changes and validate a sample change by checking pre/post configuration and rollback documentation."
Logging Requirements,Logging & Monitoring,"Verify detailed logs (user access, administrative actions, PAN access) are generated and retained per PCI retention requirements.","Trigger representative events (login, failed auth, PAN access) and confirm log entries appear with timestamps, source, and user identifiers."
Log Retention,Logging & Monitoring,"Ensure logs are retained for at least one year with three months immediately available for analysis as required by PCI.","Check log storage locations, retention policies, and run queries to retrieve logs from the last 90 days and one year to verify availability."
Log Integrity,Logging & Monitoring,"Confirm logs are protected from tampering, with secure transport and integrity controls in place (forwarding, hashing, access restrictions).","Inspect log shipping configuration (rsyslog/DB), verify remote logging, and validate file hashes or checksums to ensure log integrity."
Monitoring & Alerts,Logging & Monitoring,"Ensure real-time monitoring and alerting are configured to detect suspicious access or system compromise in the CDE.","Generate test alerts (failed logins, suspicious file access) and confirm alert delivery to SOC/monitoring consoles and ticketing systems."
Penetration Testing,Testing & Assessment,"Perform annual penetration tests (internal and external) and after significant changes to validate CDE defenses and remediation efficacy.","Run scoped pentest activities (Nmap, Burp, manual exploitation in lab) per PCI guidance and verify test reports include PoC and remediation validation."
ASV Scanning,Testing & Assessment,"Ensure quarterly external vulnerability scans are performed by an Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) and remediation is tracked.","Run an external scan with the ASV or using the same tooling to confirm public-facing vulnerabilities are detected and documented for remediation."
Segmentation Validation,Testing & Assessment,"Regularly test segmentation controls that reduce PCI scope to ensure isolation remains effective and unchanged.","From an out-of-scope host, attempt to access CDE services and validate ACLs and firewall rules block access as expected."
Service Provider Management,Third-Party,"Verify service providers with CDE access are PCI-compliant, have contracts documenting responsibilities, and are monitored.","Review provider contracts and security attestations (AOC/ROC) and validate remote access/log access by provider via logs or connection records."
Tokenization & Masking,Data Protection,"Confirm PAN is masked when displayed and tokenized or truncated in non-essential contexts to reduce data exposure.","Use application screens and API responses to check that PAN is masked (only first6/last4 shown) and raw PAN is not returned to users without need-to-know."
Data Discovery,Data Protection,"Inventory and discover locations of stored PAN across systems, files, backups, and logs to confirm no unauthorized storage exists.","Use grep, `find`, and database queries in a controlled manner to locate PAN-like patterns and validate removal or encryption of discovered instances."
Backup Protection,Data Protection,"Ensure backups containing cardholder data are encrypted, access-controlled, and included in retention and sanitization policies.","Inspect backup configs, attempt authorized access to backup stores, and verify that backups are encrypted and access is restricted."
Physical Access,Physical Security,"Confirm physical access to systems and media that store cardholder data is restricted, logged, and periodically reviewed.","Validate physical controls via walkthroughs (or documentation) and confirm access logs or CCTV evidence for sample accesses to server rooms or cabinets."
Media Handling,Physical Security,"Ensure removable media and paper containing cardholder data are protected, tracked, and securely disposed when no longer needed.","Inspect media handling procedures and verify secure deletion or shredding certificates for sample media and backup tapes."
