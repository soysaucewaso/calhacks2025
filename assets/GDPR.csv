Right to Erasure (‘Right to be Forgotten’),Data Subject Rights,"Confirm users can request deletion of their personal data and that it is removed from live and backup systems.","Submit a deletion request and verify that identifiers are purged or anonymized from databases, logs, and caches."
Right to Restrict Processing,Data Subject Rights,"Ensure users can restrict processing of their data under certain conditions.","Submit a restriction request and confirm APIs prevent non-consensual updates or transfers during restriction."
Right to Data Portability,Data Subject Rights,"Verify users can obtain their personal data in a structured, machine-readable format.","Request data export via UI/API and validate returned format (e.g., JSON, CSV) contains complete personal data without third-party fields."
Right to Object,Data Subject Rights,"Ensure users can object to processing, particularly for direct marketing or profiling.","Trigger an objection via the user interface and confirm related processing stops (marketing or analytics requests disabled)."
Profiling Transparency,Automated Decision-Making,"Ensure users are informed about profiling or automated decision-making processes affecting them.","Inspect privacy policy endpoints and forms to confirm disclosure of logic and test whether user consent gates such processing."
Third-Party Data Sharing,Accountability,"Confirm data sharing agreements and safeguards exist for all third parties receiving personal data.","Enumerate outbound connections and APIs to identify data exports and verify DPA documentation for each recipient."
International Transfers,Data Transfers,"Ensure transfers outside the EEA comply with adequacy decisions or SCCs.","Trace outbound IPs or S3 buckets to confirm data residency and review policies or configs ensuring compliant regions."
Vendor Risk Management,Accountability,"Assess data processors for compliance and security controls aligning with GDPR obligations.","Perform WHOIS/DNS lookups of vendors and verify DPA or SOC2 evidence for those processing user data."
Anonymization & Pseudonymization,Privacy by Design,"Ensure pseudonymization/anonymization techniques prevent re-identification of individuals.","Inspect anonymized datasets and attempt correlation with auxiliary fields to verify identities cannot be inferred."
Logging & Audit Trails,Accountability,"Ensure actions on personal data (view, modify, delete) are logged with traceability and integrity.","Trigger CRUD actions on personal data and check audit logs for correct user IDs, timestamps, and non-tampered entries."
Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA),Accountability,"Conduct DPIAs for high-risk processing activities to identify and mitigate risks to individuals.","Review DPIA documents and correlate with system scan outputs or APIs that handle sensitive identifiers."
Privacy by Design & Default,Privacy by Design,"Verify systems implement default privacy settings minimizing data exposure and requiring user opt-in.","Inspect app defaults and HTTP responses to confirm tracking, analytics, or PII collection is disabled by default."
Data Transfer Encryption,Security of Processing,"Ensure encryption protects data during transfer between internal systems and third parties.","Run MITM proxy with Burp in lab to confirm all API calls use HTTPS and reject invalid certificates."
Retention Policy Enforcement,Data Retention,"Confirm automatic purging of data past retention limits and verify backups follow same schedule.","Query historical logs/backups to ensure records older than the allowed retention are deleted or anonymized."
Privacy Notices,Transparency,"Ensure privacy notices clearly explain data collection, purpose, rights, and controller contact info.","Fetch and review privacy policy endpoints and confirm presence of GDPR-required disclosures via curl and regex."
Employee Access Review,Accountability,"Verify periodic reviews ensure only current staff need access to personal data systems.","Compare IAM access lists against HR roster and attempt (authorized) login with an inactive account to confirm access denial."
